# Telegram Contest March 2019 â€“ Graph

This simple app renders line graph with fancy transition animations.

It is implemented from scratch using pure JavaScript, without any dependencies.

## Demo

## Build

Production mode: `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Development mode: `yarn start`

> Note: `npm start` may not work. As of March 2019 there is a bug in `npm` which prevents `webpack-dev-server` from starting. Yarn works just fine.
